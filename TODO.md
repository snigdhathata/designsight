## üöß Known Limitations

### AI Analysis
- **Coordinate Accuracy**: AI-generated coordinates may not perfectly align with visual elements
- **Analysis Quality**: Feedback quality depends on OpenAI model performance
- **Image Size**: Large images may take longer to process
- **Rate Limits**: OpenAI API has rate limits that may affect concurrent users

### User Experience
- **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket implementation for live collaboration
- **Mobile Support**: Limited mobile responsiveness for design viewer
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: No keyboard navigation for feedback items
- **Bulk Operations**: No bulk upload or analysis features

### Technical
- **File Storage**: Local file storage (not suitable for production)
- **Database**: No database migrations or backup strategy
- **Caching**: No caching layer for improved performance
- **Monitoring**: No application monitoring or logging

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 - Core Improvements
- [ ] Real-time collaboration with WebSockets
- [ ] Improved coordinate mapping accuracy
- [ ] Mobile-optimized design viewer
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
- [ ] Bulk design upload and analysis

### Phase 2 - Advanced Features
- [ ] Design system integration
- [ ] Version control for designs
- [ ] Advanced AI models (Claude, Gemini)
- [ ] Custom feedback templates
- [ ] Team management and permissions

### Phase 3 - Enterprise Features
- [ ] Cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Google Cloud)
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Slack/Teams integration
- [ ] API rate limiting and quotas
- [ ] Multi-tenant architecture

## üêõ Bug Fixes Needed

- [ ] Fix coordinate scaling for different image sizes
- [ ] Improve error messages for AI analysis failures
- [ ] Handle edge cases in file upload
- [ ] Fix memory leaks in image processing
- [ ] Improve loading states and user feedback

## üìù Technical Debt

- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Add database migrations
- [ ] Optimize image processing pipeline
- [ ] Add API documentation with Swagger
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

## üîß Development Notes

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Or run individually
cd server && npm run dev
cd client && npm start
```

### Environment Setup
1. Copy `server/env.example` to `server/.env`
2. Add your OpenAI API key
3. Adjust other settings as needed

### Testing
- Backend tests: `cd server && npm test`
- Frontend tests: `cd client && npm test`
- Integration tests: Not implemented yet

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **Image Processing**: Large images may cause memory issues
- **AI Analysis**: Concurrent analysis requests may hit rate limits
- **Database**: No indexing strategy for large datasets
- **Frontend**: No code splitting or lazy loading

## üîí Security Considerations

- **File Uploads**: Basic validation only
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens without refresh mechanism
- **API Security**: No rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- **Data Privacy**: No data encryption at rest

## üìà Scalability

- **Current**: Single instance, local storage
- **Recommended**: Load balancer, cloud storage, database clustering
- **Limitations**: No horizontal scaling implemented

**Note**: This is a prototype application. For production use, address the limitations and implement proper security, monitoring, and scalability measures.
